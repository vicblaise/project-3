## How to play


Rock paper scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which 
each player forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are 
"rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" 
(a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).
it has three possible outcomes:a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to
play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors ("rock crushes scissors"
or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has 
played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors
("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied
and is usually replayed to break the tie.
